# Assembler Directives

> **Random Quote:** Discipline equals freedom.

This directory contains files dedicated exclusively to **assembler directives** used in x86 Assembly programming (Intel syntax). Each file provides a focused explanation of a specific directive, such as `ORG`, `BITS`, or `TIMES`.

The links listed below are organized in **alphabetical order** for ease of reference. However, you are strongly advised not to study these directives in alphabetical order, as doing so may disrupt the natural learning progression.

Instead, follow the recommended sequence provided in the project's learning [roadmap](../../roadmap/README.md), which outlines when and where each directive is introduced in context.

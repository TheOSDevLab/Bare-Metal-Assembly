# Intel Syntax

> **Random Quote:** Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life; he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.

The Intel syntax is one of the most widely used assembly language formats, especially in educational materials, tutorials, and operating system development. It is the default syntax used by the **NASM** and **MASM** assemblers.

Intel syntax will be used throughout this repository in all standalone Assembly code and projects written using NASM. Its clarity and straightforwardness make it ideal for beginners learning to write low-level code for the x86 architecture.

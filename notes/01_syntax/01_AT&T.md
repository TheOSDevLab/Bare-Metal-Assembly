# AT&T Syntax

> **Random Quote:** As water reflects the face, so one's life reflects the heart.

AT&T syntas is the default assembly language format used by the **GNU Assembler (GAS)** and many Unix-based toolchains, including GCC.

Although this syntax can appear more complex at first, understanding it is essential in contexts such as **inline Assembly in C** (particularly in environments where GCC and GAS are used) in kernel development or low-level system code.

## Introduction

This BIOS video service, invoked via `INT 10h` with `AH = 02h`, is used to **set the screen cursorâ€™s position** in text mode. It exists to give precise control over where the next character will appear; an essential feature for text-based interfaces such as bootloaders or BIOS menus.

### Behavior

When executed:

- The BIOS updates the internal cursor location to the specified row and column within the chosen video page.
- Subsequent text output operations will begin at this new position.
- If the specified coordinates are outside the visible text area (e.g., too low or too far to the right), the cursor may vanish or behave unpredictably.

---

## Register Breakdown

- `AH`: Must be set to `0x02` to select the "Set Cursor Position" function.
- `BH`: Video page number (commonly `0` in single-page setups; ranges from 0 to 7).
- `DH`: Row (Y coordinate), zero-based (top of the screen is row 0).
- `DL`: Column (X coordinate), zero-based (leftmost column is 0).

Registers not listed here are not used or preserved by the BIOS during this function.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```asm
mov ah, 0x02     ; Select "Set Cursor Position"
mov bh, 0        ; Video page 0
mov dh, 10       ; Row 10 (11th row, zero-based)
mov dl, 20       ; Column 20 (21st column)
int 0x10         ; BIOS call
```

This moves the cursor to row 10, column 20 on the screen.

### Extended Example: Print at a Specific Position

```asm
; Position cursor before printing a character
mov ah, 0x02
mov bh, 0
mov dh, 5        ; Row 5
mov dl, 10       ; Column 10
int 0x10

; Print 'X' at the new cursor location
mov ah, 0x0E     ; Teletype output (INT 10h, AH=0Eh)
mov al, 'X'
mov bh, 0
int 0x10
```

In this sequence, the cursor is precisely positioned before output, ensuring accurate placement of the character.

---

### Special Case: Preventing the Cursor from Disappearing

```asm
mov ah, 0x02
mov bh, 0
mov dh, 24       ; Last text row (in 80x25 mode)
mov dl, 79       ; Last column
int 0x10
```

This places the cursor at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Be cautious; some video BIOS implementations may render the cursor invisible if it moves outside display bounds.

## Introduction

`INT 10h` function `00h` is a BIOS video service that configures the display hardware into a **specific video mode**.

By setting the video mode, you define:

+ Whether the screen is in text or graphics mode.
+ The number of rows and columns (in text mode) or the resolution (in graphics mode).
+ The amount of color information available.
+ The video memory layout used by the hardware.

Without explicitly setting a mode, you may inherit a display state left by the BIOS or boot manager, which can be inconsistent or incompatible with your program's expectations.

Once the interrupt is executed, the selected mode is active immediately. The screen is cleared, and the cursor is reset to the top-left corner by default.

## Register Breakdown

| Register | Value  | Description                           |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `AH`     | `0x00` | Function code for "Set Video Mode"    |
| `AL`     | `mode` | Desired video mode number             |

### Common Video Modes

| Mode (AL) | Type     | Resolution or Dimensions | Colors     | Description                 |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| `0x00`    | Text     | 40×25 characters         | 16         | Monochrome text             |
| `0x01`    | Text     | 40×25 characters         | 16         | Color text                  |
| `0x02`    | Text     | 80×25 characters         | 16         | Monochrome text             |
| `0x03`    | Text     | 80×25 characters         | 16         | Color text                  |
| `0x04`    | Graphics | 320×200 pixels           | 4          | CGA graphics                |
| `0x06`    | Graphics | 640×200 pixels           | 2          | CGA high-resolution         |
| `0x0D`    | Graphics | 320×200 pixels           | 16         | EGA graphics                |
| `0x0E`    | Graphics | 640×200 pixels           | 16         | EGA graphics                |
| `0x0F`    | Graphics | 640×350 pixels           | Monochrome | EGA graphics                |
| `0x12`    | Graphics | 640×480 pixels           | 16         | VGA graphics                |
| `0x13`    | Graphics | 320×200 pixels           | 256        | VGA 256-color graphics mode |

**Note:** Mode values are hardware-dependent but well standardized for legacy VGA-compatible BIOS implementations.

**Note:** Most bootloaders and early kernels use mode `0x03` (80x25 color text mode) for simplicity.

**Note:** Not all BIOS implementations support every mode listed. To check what modes are supported, use `INT 10h` function `1Ah`, subfunction `00h` (Get Video System Configuration). You won't need to do this if you'll be using QEMU to test your bootloader.

## Examples

### Set Text Mode 80x25

```asm
mov ah, 0x00    ; Set video mode function.
mov al, 0x03    ; 80x25 color text mode.
int 0x10        ; Call BIOS.
```

This sets the display to the standard color text mode used by most BIOS boot screens and DOS consoles.

### Set Graphics Mode 320x200 (256 colors)

```asm
mov ah, 0x00    ; Set video mode function.
mov al, 0x13    ; 320x200, 256-color graphics mode.
int 0x10        ; Call BIOS.
```

This configures the display to a commonly used graphics mode, popular in demo scenes and early graphical operating system prototypes.

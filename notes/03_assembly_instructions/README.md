## About This Directory

This directory contains focused explanations of **assembly instructions** used in x86 Assembly programming (Intel syntax). Each file covers a specific instruction (such as `MOV`, `ADD`, and others), explaining its purpose, usage, and relevance in low-level development.

The links listed below are organized in **alphabetical order** for ease of reference. However, you are strongly advised not to study these instructions in alphabetical order, as doing so may disrupt the natural learning progression.

Instead, follow the recommended sequence provided in the project's learning [roadmap](../../roadmap/README.md), which outlines when and where each instruction is introduces in context.

## Overview
_A brief introduction to what this instruction does and why it exists._

### How It Works
_A deeper dive into the internal behavior:_
- What happens when the CPU executes it.
- Which flags or registers are affected.
- Any special characteristics (e.g., sign extension, atomicity).

## Syntax
_Show the basic form and explain the operands._

```asm
mnemonic destination, source
```

* **destination:** valid types (register, memory, etc.)
* **source:** valid types (immediate, register, memory)
* **Restrictions:** e.g., no memory-to-memory

### Instruction Size

*Explain encoding details and byte size.*

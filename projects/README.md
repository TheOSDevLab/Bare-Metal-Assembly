## Overview

This directory contains practical Assembly projects designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the notes. Each project focuses on a specific set of instructions, directives, or system-level mechanisms relevant to bootloader and OS development.

For best results, it is strongly recommended that you complete the projects in the order outlined in the [roadmap](../roadmap/README.md). Each project builds on concepts introduced in the previous one, ensuring a smooth progression from basic data movement to more advanced control flow and memory manipulation. Skipping ahead may result in confusion or overlooked foundational skills that are essential for later stages of OS development.

> **Note:** All projects in this directory are written in Intel syntax and are designed to run in real mode (16-bit), typically from a bootloader environment.

## Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own subdirectory and contains:

+ `README.md`: A description of the project and learning objectives.
+ `main.asm`: The main source file.
+ Optional files (e.g., binaries, debug logs, diagrams, or test inputs).

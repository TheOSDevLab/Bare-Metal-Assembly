## Overview

This directory contains Assembly projects that demonstrate how to use BIOS interrupts to interact with low-level hardware features such as the screen, keyboard, and disk drives.

Each project focuses on a specific interrupt or function, helping you to understand how the BIOS provides essential hardware services in the absence of an operating system.

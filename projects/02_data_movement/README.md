## Overview

This directory contains beginner-friendly projects that focus on **data movement instructions** in x86 Assembly, such as `MOV`, `XCHG`, and `LEA`. These instructions form the foundation of all low-level programming enabling the transfer of data between registers, memory, and immediate values. Each project is designed to reinforce how data is accessed, stored, and manipulated in real-mode execution.

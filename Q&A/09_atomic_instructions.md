# Atomic Instructions

**Atomic instructions** are processor-level operations that execute as indivisible units of work. From the perspective of other threads or processors, an atomic instruction appears to occur instantaneously: it cannot be interrupted or partially completed. This property makes atomic instructions essential in concurrent programming, as they ensure consistency when multiple execution contexts access or modify shared data.

## Example: The `INC` Instruction

The `INC` instruction increments the value of a register or a memory operand by one. While this may seem like a simple, single-step operation, it is internally composed of multiple micro-operations: reading the operand, performing the addition, and writing the result back to the destination.

In a multiprocessor environment, if two threads simultaneously execute `INC` on the same shared memory location **without atomicity**, a **lost update** problem can occur. For example:

1. Thread A reads the current value.
2. Thread B reads the same current value before A completes its write.
3. Both increment their local copies.
4. The last thread to write overwrites the otherâ€™s result.

The outcome is that the shared variable is incremented only once instead of twice, leading to data inconsistency.

To prevent this, the instruction can be prefixed with `LOCK`, as in:

```asm
lock inc [mem]
```

The `LOCK` prefix ensures the entire read-modify-write sequence is executed atomically, blocking other processors from accessing the memory location until the operation completes.

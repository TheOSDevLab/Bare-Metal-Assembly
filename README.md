# Bare-Metal-Assembly

> **Random Quote:** Before software can be reusable, it first has to be usable.

This repository contains notes, explanations, and examples of Assembly programming with a focus on operating system development. It is part of a broader series of repositories dedicated to low-level systems programming and crafting an operating system from scratch.

- [**`resources/`**](./resources): PDFs, images, and other external stuff I found useful (too good to gatekeep).
- [**`roadmap/`**](./roadmap): A detailed roadmap to help figure out where to start.
- [**`tools/`**](./tools): Scripts for all sorts of automation to deal with the boring parts and save time.
